Nowadays, clichés play a significant role in shaping our view of the world. For instance, when one considers France, there is a tendency to connect it with emblematic symbols such as Eiffel Tower, cheese, wine or even cigarettes. Similarly, when thinking about the sun, it’s common to associate it directly with certain countries, such as Costa Rica or Mexico. Whereas these associations accurately reflect reality is a matter of debate. Nevertheless, a question may arise: **How do these clichés shape our processes of thought?**

Using the Wikispeedia dataset, our objective is to analyze the impact of clichés in our research process, with a primary emphasis on those associated with different countries. The dataset provides all the paths of the players, finished and unfinished, allowing us to establish whether they rely on common ideas or concepts to navigate through the pages. In this case, clichés manifest in the form of Wikipedia’s article or categories of these articles.

In understanding real-world networks, it is crucial to recognize the specific way in which they are connected. Wikipedia, being a representative of a similar network, is made of hyperlinks that contains many short-range, and few long-range, connections. This specific semantic space is perceived by humans, and Wikispeedia, as a game, becomes particularly interesting in tackling the small world property. Through our exploration, we will specifically consider how our notion of clichés aids us in navigating through the hyperlinks. One may wonder: **does clichés help us navigate through the game and increase our chance to win?**

## *What do we have ?*

The dataset is composed of many different articles and categories. Our analysis is based on clichés about countries, raising the question of their substantial representation in the dataset. The answer is yes: among the top fifty most visited articles, seventeen focus on countries or continents, indicating a recurrent theme within the dataset. We remark that the most visited article being the United States of America with more than 8000 occurences.

Furthermore, the articles within the top fifty targets articles feature less notable presence of countries or continent. But then, one may wonder why countries are such a prevalent theme within the paths. (??)

## *What about clichés ?*

What about clichés? Well, if we look at the example of the United-Kingdom, by finding a list of clichés through different methods such as data augmentation, we find that (??).

<p style="color:blue"><em>Compare path length/difference of length with the shortest path of paths with clichés and without clichés?
Same with ratings?</p>

<p style="color:blue">Compare the number of occurrences of countries/continent categories within paths with different target/starting categories?</p>

<p style="color:blue">Performance</em></p>

## *But are there any clichés in the articles that are not hyperlinked?*
